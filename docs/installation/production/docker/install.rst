To get started using Docker, you'll first need to install it. Docker provide excellent documentation for installation that can be found here: `Get Docker | Docker Documentation <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_. This tutorial provides shortcuts to installation instructions that are most relevant to Tethys app developers.

Linux
=====

Docker provides `installation instructions for the most popular Linux distributions <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server>`_ including (CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Raspbian, RHEL, SLES, and Ubuntu). It should be possible to install it on other Linux distributions. As we recommend deploying Tethys Platform on either CentOS or Ubuntu, links to the installation instructions for these two distributions are provided below:

* `Install Docker Engine on CentOS | Docker Documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/>`_
* `Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu | Docker Documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/>`_

Notes:

* We recommend using the **Install using the repository** method.
